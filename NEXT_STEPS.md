# Next Steps for Implementation and Expansion

## 1. Core Implementation
- Move all reusable logic and main modules into the `src/` directory.
- Use `main.py` as a simple entry point that imports and runs code from `src/`.
- Keep scripts in `scripts/` for automation, data processing, or orchestration.

## 2. Testing
- Add unit and integration tests in the `tests/` directory, mirroring the structure of `src/`.
- Use `pytest` or `unittest` for test discovery and execution.

## 3. Dependency Management
- Use Poetry for dependency management (`pyproject.toml`).
- Export requirements for Docker/Colab with `poetry export -f requirements.txt --without-hashes > requirements.txt`.

## 4. Code Quality
- Set up pre-commit hooks: `pre-commit install`.
- Use `black`, `isort`, `flake8`, and `mypy` for formatting, linting, and type checking.

## 5. Documentation
- Expand documentation in the `docs/` directory.
- Keep module-level and function-level docstrings up to date.

## 6. Notebooks
- Place all Jupyter/Colab notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory for experiments and demos.

## 7. Environment
- Use `.env.example` to document required environment variables.
- Add a `.env` file (not committed) for local development.

## 8. Expansion Ideas
- Add Docker support for reproducible environments.
- Integrate CI/CD (GitHub Actions) for automated testing and linting.
- Add cloud deployment scripts (GCP, AWS, etc.) if needed.
- Modularize code for scalability and maintainability.
